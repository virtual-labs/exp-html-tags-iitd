### These steps will be followed on the simulator

1. The experiment begins with previewing the output of different attributes and their values associsted with various text in Preview Section given at the top of the Simulator by hovering the cursor in the Select Tag -> Attribute -> Value Section given below.

2. After previewing the output click on any of the Attribute -> Value through given navigation, to see the syntax of that particular attribute in adjacent the Syntax Section.

3. After Understanding the Syntax of any specific HTML attribute, write code for that particular attribute in the Write Code Section given at the left bottom of simulator.

4. If there will be any error in the code then Simulator will highlight that error so that it can be rectified.

5. Finally after rectifying the errors the result of correct HTML code can be seen in the adjacent Preview Result Section.
